I'll help create a detailed tutorial for setting up a very basic CI/CD pipeline in GitLab. Let me structure this step-by-step.

# Tutorial: Creating Your First GitLab CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create and run your very first CI/CD pipeline in GitLab. We'll create a simple pipeline that outputs a "Hello" message.

**Time Required:** ~15-20 minutes
**Prerequisites:**
- A GitLab.com account
- A phone number for account verification

## Step 1: Account Verification
Before you can run any pipelines, you need to verify your GitLab account:

1. Navigate to your project
2. When you try to run a pipeline, GitLab will prompt you to verify your account
3. Click "Verify my account"
4. Enter your phone number
5. Complete the verification puzzle
6. Enter the verification code received via SMS
7. Click "Next" to complete verification

> **Note:** Account verification is required to prevent abuse of GitLab's free tier resources.

## Step 2: Configure the Web IDE
We'll use GitLab's Web IDE to create our pipeline configuration:

1. From your project page, click the "Edit" button
2. Select "Web IDE" from the dropdown menu
3. Configure the IDE settings:
   - Click the settings gear icon
   - Go to "Themes" and select your preferred theme (optional)
   - Search for "whitespace" in settings
   - Set "Render Whitespace" to "all"

## Step 3: Create the Pipeline Configuration
Now we'll create the pipeline configuration file:

1. In the Web IDE, hover over the project root and click the "New file" icon
2. Name the file exactly: `.gitlab-ci.yml` (the leading dot is crucial)
3. Add the following basic configuration:
```yaml
test:
  script:
    - echo "Hello!"
```

This configuration creates:
- A job named `test`
- A single command that prints "Hello!"

## Step 4: Commit the Pipeline Configuration
1. Click on "Source Control" in the Web IDE menu
2. Enter a commit message (e.g., "Added pipeline")
3. Click "Commit to 'main'"
4. Select "Continue" when prompted about branch creation

## Step 5: View and Run the Pipeline
1. Return to your project's main page
2. You should see a pipeline indicator next to your commit
3. Click on the pipeline indicator to view details
4. The pipeline will run automatically and execute your test job
5. When complete, you should see the "Hello!" output in the job logs

## Testing the Pipeline
To verify everything works:

1. Go back to the Web IDE
2. Modify the echo command to say "Hello 2!"
2. Commit the changes
3. A new pipeline will trigger automatically
4. View the pipeline to see your updated message

## Troubleshooting
If your pipeline doesn't run:
- Verify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` filename is exactly correct (including the dot)
- Ensure your account verification is complete
- Check that the YAML formatting is correct (indentation matters)

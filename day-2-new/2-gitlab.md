## What is GitLab?

GitLab is like a Swiss Army knife for software development - it's a single tool that helps you with every step of building software, from planning to deployment. Think of it as your digital workspace where you can:

- Plan and track your work
- Store and manage your code
- Test and verify your changes
- Deploy your applications
- Collaborate with your team

The power of GitLab comes from having everything in one place. Instead of juggling multiple tools and copying information between them, everything lives in GitLab and works together seamlessly.
